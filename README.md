Homework 1 
Suppose that you are an investment manager with a   bank,   and   you’represented with   the following   investment   opportunities   of   loans.   You   are   evaluating   the   loans   on 31   Dec, 2024. All   payments are in arrears (meaning   payment   at   end   of each   period).

Loan 1 
Loan 2 
Loan 3 
Loan 4 
Drawdowns 
$14 million on Dec 31, 2024 
$22 million on 31 Dec, 2024 
$16 million on 31 Dec 2024, and $4 million on 30 Jun 2026. 
$20 million on Dec 31, 2027 
Term (years from first Drawdown to maturity) 
7 yrs 
9 yrs 
6 yrs 
5 yrs 



Repayment Schedule 
Loan is paid back in equal 
installments, meaning that 
the total payment (principal 
+ interest) for each period is 
the same. Payment is made 
semi-annually 

Interest is paid semi-annually 
for the first 5 years, then the 
loan is then paid back in 
equal installments. 


Interest is paid semi-annually. 
The principal is paid back at 
maturity. 
Interest is capitalized semi- 
annually for the first 2 years and 
is paid semi-annually thereafter. 
Then the loan (with the 
capitalized interest) will be paid 
back with equal principal 
payments semi-annually. 

Interest Rate 

6.50% 
8% for the interest only 
periods, 8.5% during the 
remaining periods. 

7.00% 
9.5% for the first two years, 
10.5% for the remainder of the 
years. 
1.          List out the cash flow and   outstanding   amount   for   each   loan   for   every   year with   semi-annual   frequency.   See   template   provided   in   the   Excel workbook.   Note that you only   need to fill the years for each   loan as   they   last.
2.          Assume a discount   rate of 5%, calculate the   net   代 写FIN6102 Spreadsheet and VBA Modelling in Finance Homework 1Python

3.          Suppose that you   have only 40   million dollars   budget, so   you   can’t   take   all   the   loans. Assuming   you   can   either   choose   one   investment   or   leave   it   (i.e.,      you cannot choose to invest in a fraction   of the   investment). Your   target   is   to   maximize   the future value   of your   portfolio   at   the   end   of year 2033, which   loans will you choose?
4.          If you can   invest at any   fraction   of the   loan   (but   not   more   than   100%),   how   should   you   construct your   portfolio? Assume   that   no   interest   will   be   earned   for   cash at   hand.   Describe the   process of solving the   problem. (Hint:   use Solver)
5.          What   if you can earn an interest of   5% for   your   remaining   cash   at   hand   (use   semi-annual   compounding),   will   that   change   your   answer for   question   3   and   4? What is the final value of your portfolio at the   end   of 2033?
6.          If each loan   has   an   independent   probability of default   of   1%   on   the   date   of   Dec   31,   2028   (the   last   day   of 4 years).   There   is   no   probability   of default   at   any   other time.   If they default, you will   lose all   the outstanding   principal   in the loan.   For   the   portfolio   that   you   constructed   in   4:
a.          What is your 4-year 99%   Value at   Risk   (in   million   dollars)?
b.          What is your 4-year 99%   Expected Shortfall   (in   million   dollars)?
Hint: at end of Dec 31, 2028, your   portfolio   value   =   cash   at   hand   +   principal   that   has   not   defaulted.   Calculate   the   probability   of each   portfolio   value   and   its   PL. Then use it for VaR/ES   calculation.
